        <h2>ABOUT</h2>
        <p>
          Hi, I'm Leroy Jay. I love coding, crypto and cooking.
        </p>
          <p>I've always been an avid gamer. (Anyone remember the Sinclair Spectrum?)
          </p>
          <p>After decades of playing games I became interested in the blockchain. In my 
            opinion, true digital ownership is the future of gaming! Trust me bro!
          </p>
          <p>
             I started out building websites with HTML and CSS.
          Since then, Javascript and Solidity have been added to my bow.
          </p>
          <p>I also have a working knowledge of Python and cybersecurity.
          </p>
          <p>Knowledge never takes a holiday, that's why I'm always adding to my bow
          </p>
